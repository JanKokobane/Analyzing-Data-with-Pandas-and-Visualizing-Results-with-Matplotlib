# Analyzing-Data-with-Pandas-and-Visualizing-Results-with-Matplotlib

Description
This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization techniques using Python. The dataset used is the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset for classification problems, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers.

The project consists of three main tasks:

Data loading and exploration.
Basic statistical analysis.
Data visualization to uncover trends and patterns.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the code:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn (to load the Iris dataset)
Install these libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
How to Run
Clone or Copy the Code
Copy the code into a Python script (e.g., data_analysis.py) or Jupyter Notebook.

Run the Script
Execute the code in a Python environment.

View the Results

The script will display information about the dataset, such as missing values and basic statistics.
Visualizations will be shown in pop-up windows or inline (if using a notebook).
Code Overview
Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
Load the Iris dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Inspect the first few rows and check for missing values or incorrect data types.
Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
Compute summary statistics for numerical columns (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
Group data by species and calculate average values for each group.
Task 3: Data Visualization
Line Chart: Simulates trends in sepal length for each species.
Bar Chart: Displays average petal length across species.
Histogram: Shows the distribution of sepal width.
Scatter Plot: Highlights the relationship between sepal length and petal length, categorized by species.
Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples divided into three species:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Features include:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
Example Visualizations
Line Chart: Trends in Sepal Length
Bar Chart: Average Petal Length by Species
Histogram: Distribution of Sepal Width
Scatter Plot: Sepal Length vs. Petal Length
Error Handling
The code includes error handling for:

File not found errors (when loading a CSV file).
Missing or empty datasets.
Other exceptions related to file loading.
Customization
To use your own dataset:

Replace the Iris dataset loading section with:
python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
Ensure your dataset contains both numerical and categorical columns for proper analysis and visualization.
